# Rock,Paper,Scissors
## Javascript Essentials Project 2

![Responsive](/readme-resources/images/responsive.png)

Rock,paper,scissors is a game which is built using HTML,CSS and Javascript. The aim of the game is for the player to play against the computer in 10 rounds of intense rock,paper,scissors. If the player reaches 10 first then a html webpage is shown which indicates the player being the winner â€ hen asking if you would like to play again. Similar is shown if the game is tied or the computer wins.

The rules are simple: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. First to 10 wins as explained above.

The website must be responsive, simple and easy to play.

## Testing
<hr>

### Functionality/Compatibility Testing

For functionality testing I tested my website in all diffrent sizes in chrome, firefox and safari. 

In chrome the site looked just fine on all devices.

- Used dev tools to check everything works with diffrent screen sizes. all seemed to be fine. 
- All areas have great contrast and seem to be easy to see.
- Form works fine and submit button works. Did find a bug with the hover function of the button being out of place. Fixed below in bugs section.

However in Safari and firefox all looked fine apart from the nav bar font which looked slightly thinner then usual. This was the same accross all device sizes.

![safari-blurry](/readme-resources/images/safari-blurry.png)

Result: After speaking with external help (tutors) We came to a conclusion as it's just the way the browsers render. Possible change of font could fix in the future. 


### Code Validator Testing

 [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Bugs

Hover bug:

Before hover:

![signup](/readme-resources/images/signup.png)

After Hover: 

![submit-hover-bug](/readme-resources/images/submit-hover-bug.png)

**Solved Bugs**

Hover Bug:

Removed from #submit-button:hover:
margin-top: 5%;
padding: 1% 1%;


added to #submit-button:hover:
display: block;
margin: 1% auto;

- I must have missed this when adjusting the submit button code in css.
