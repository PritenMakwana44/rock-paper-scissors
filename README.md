# Rock,Paper,Scissors
## Javascript Essentials Project 2

![Responsive](/readme-resources/images/responsive.png)

Rock,paper,scissors is a game which is built using HTML,CSS and Javascript. The aim of the game is for the player to play against the computer in 10 rounds of intense rock,paper,scissors. If the player reaches 10 first then a html webpage is shown which indicates the player being the winner â€ hen asking if you would like to play again. Similar is shown if the game is tied or the computer wins.

The rules are simple: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. First to 10 wins as explained above.

The website must be responsive, simple and easy to play.

## Features
<hr>

The website contains 3 sections. First is the title section, second is the game section and last is the rules section. I purposely added no header or footer. But can be used in the future if needed. as it's a simple site I didn't think there was much need for either.

**Page load popup for rules**
- When the page is loaded there is an alert which tells the player what the rules. 
- The player then has to click okay to continue.


![Rules-popup](/readme-resources/images/pageloadalert.png)


**Headings section**
- Main and first heading holds the title which reads 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'.
- Next is a second heading which reads 'Can you beat me?'

![Headings](/readme-resources/images/headings.png)

**Games Area**
- There are 3 buttons which indicate Rock, paper, scissors. These are used to play the game.
- Underneath the buttons section is the player score. If the player wins the round the player score increments by 1 and turns green.
- Below the player score is the computer score. If the computer wins the round the computer score increments by 1 and turns red.
- If both computer and player scores are tied then both will turn blue. 
- Underneath the scores section is the round win indicator which shows if the round winner is player, computer or if it's tied. 
- First to win 10 rounds wins. There is a pop up on the screen and a redirection to another html page depending on win, lose or tie.

![Games-Area](/readme-resources/images/gamearea.png)

**Player/Computer win or tie page**
- When the player or computer reaches 10 wins then first an alert which says 'gameover - player/computer wins!'.
- If it's a tie the alert also activates.
- Once the alert comes up the player must click 'ok'.
- The you are redirected to a html site according to win, lose or tie. These are all seperate html files.
- Each page has a button if the player wants to play again.

## Testing
<hr>

### Functionality/Compatibility Testing

For functionality testing I tested my website in all diffrent sizes in chrome, firefox and safari. 

My project looked great on all browsers and were  responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop.


### Code Validator Testing

 [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
 
 [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
 
 [Jshint Validator](https://jshint.com/)

## Bugs
<hr>

External html on Github bug:
- The bug was a case that the page redirects to the playerwin/computerwin/tie htmls not working on Github. These worked when tested on Gitpod via locations with root access e.g "location.href = "/playerwin.html";"

Here is the code in Javascript for function Gameover() before change:

function Gameover() {

    if (playerScore === 10) {
        alert('Gameover - Player Wins!');
        location.href = "/playerwin.html";
        resetScores();
    } else if (computerScore === 10) {
        alert('Gameover - Computer Wins!');
        location.href = "/computerwin.html";
        resetScores();
    } else if (computerScore === 10 && playerScore === 10) {
        alert('Gameover - Tie Game!');
        location.href = "/tie.html";
        resetScores();

    }

The error page looked like this:
![bug-error-redirect](/readme-resources/images/websiteredirectbug.png)

**Solved Bugs**

External html on Github bug:
- Fix was to specify root with with "rock-paper-scissors".

See below for code to fix.

function Gameover() {

    if (playerScore === 10) {
        alert('Gameover - Player Wins!');
        location.href = "/rock-paper-scissors/playerwin.html";
        resetScores();
    } else if (computerScore === 10) {
        alert('Gameover - Computer Wins!');
        location.href = "/rock-paper-scissors/computerwin.html";
        resetScores();
    } else if (computerScore === 10 && playerScore === 10) {
        alert('Gameover - Tie Game!');
        location.href = "/rock-paper-scissors/tie.html";
        resetScores();

    }


## Deployment

To deploy Github the steps I took are below:

1. Log into your Github account.
2. Go to your repositories
3. Click on your project (e.g rock-paper-scissors)
4. Click settings which should be in the middle of the page.
5. on the left side under 'Code and automation', you should find a tab called pages. Click this tab.
6. Branch should say main and folder should say root. Click save. 
7. It then should say 'Your site is being published at "Here would be your url for site"

Published url: [https://pritenmakwana44.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/](https://pritenmakwana44.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

To run locally:
1. Log into your Github account.
2. Go to your repositories
3. Click on your project (e.g rock-paper-scissors)
4. Click 'code' then 'Download ZIP' Or if you use Gitpod you should see a Gitpod button next to code to deploy.
5. Once you download the zip you should then be able to run the project locally.
