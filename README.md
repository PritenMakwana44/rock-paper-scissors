# Rock,Paper,Scissors
## Javascript Essentials Project 2

![Responsive](/readme-resources/images/responsive.png)

Rock,paper,scissors is a game which is built using HTML,CSS and Javascript. The aim of the game is for the player to play against the computer in 10 rounds of intense rock,paper,scissors. If the player reaches 10 first then a html webpage is shown which indicates the player being the winner â€ hen asking if you would like to play again. Similar is shown if the game is tied or the computer wins.

The rules are simple: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. First to 10 wins as explained above.

The website must be responsive, simple and easy to play.

## Features
<hr>

The website contains 3 sections. First is the title section, second is the game section and last is the rules section. I purposely added no header or footer. But can be used in the future if needed. as it's a simple site I didn't think there was much need for either.

**Page load popup for rules**
- When the page is loaded there is an alert which tells the player what the rules. 
- The player then has to click okay to continue.


![Rules-popup](/readme-resources/images/pageloadalert.png)


**Headings section**
- Main and first heading holds the title which reads 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'.
- Next is a second heading which reads 'Can you beat me?'

![Headings](/readme-resources/images/headings.png)

**Games Area**
- There are 3 buttons which indicate Rock, paper, scissors. These are used to play the game.
- Underneath the buttons section is the player score. If the player wins the round the player score increments by 1 and turns green.
- Below the player score is the computer score. If the computer wins the round the computer score increments by 1 and turns red.
- If both computer and player scores are tied then both will turn blue. 
- Underneath the scores section is the round win indicator which shows if the round winner is player, computer or if it's tied. 
- First to win 10 rounds wins. There is a pop up on the screen and a redirection to another html page depending on win, lose or tie.

**Player/Computer win or tie page**

## Testing
<hr>

### Functionality/Compatibility Testing

For functionality testing I tested my website in all diffrent sizes in chrome, firefox and safari. 

In chrome the site looked just fine on all devices.

- Used dev tools to check everything works with diffrent screen sizes. all seemed to be fine. 
- All areas have great contrast and seem to be easy to see.
- Form works fine and submit button works. Did find a bug with the hover function of the button being out of place. Fixed below in bugs section.

However in Safari and firefox all looked fine apart from the nav bar font which looked slightly thinner then usual. This was the same accross all device sizes.

![safari-blurry](/readme-resources/images/safari-blurry.png)

Result: After speaking with external help (tutors) We came to a conclusion as it's just the way the browsers render. Possible change of font could fix in the future. 


### Code Validator Testing

 [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
 [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) 

 ### SEO Testing

 Below are screenshots taken from the chrome dev tools lighthouse function to evaluate SEO of the website.

## Bugs

Hover bug:
- When hovering over the submit button it is the correct colour, just the button is out of place. 

Before hover:

![signup](/readme-resources/images/signup.png)

After Hover: 

![submit-hover-bug](/readme-resources/images/submit-hover-bug.png)

**Solved Bugs**

Hover Bug:

Removed from #submit-button:hover:
margin-top: 5%;
padding: 1% 1%;


added to #submit-button:hover:
display: block;
margin: 1% auto;

- I must have missed this when adjusting the submit button code in css.

2. Go to your repositories
3. Click on your project (e.g the-meditation-club)
4. Click settings which should be in the middle of the page.
5. on the left side under 'Code and automation', you should find a tab called pages. Click this tab.
6. Branch should say main and folder should say root. Click save. 
7. It then should say 'Your site is being published at "Here would be your url for site"

Published url: [https://pritenmakwana44.github.io/the-meditation-club/](https://pritenmakwana44.github.io/the-meditation-club/)

To run locally:
1. Log into your Github account.
2. Go to your repositories
3. Click on your project (e.g the-meditation-club)
4. Click 'code' then 'Download ZIP' Or if you use Gitpod you should see a Gitpod button next to code to deploy.
